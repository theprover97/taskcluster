              A secret value shared with the worker.  This value must be passed in the `workerIdentityProof` of the `registerWorker` method.
              The ideal way to generate a secret of this form is `slugid() + slugid()`.

              Secrets are traded for Taskcluster credentials, and should be treated with similar care.
              Each worker should have a distinct secret.
