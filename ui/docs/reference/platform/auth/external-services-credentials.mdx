title: External Service Credentials
order: 50
---

The auth service has API methods for delegating access to external services such as AWS S3 or Sentry.
This functionality allows the exchange of Taskcluster credentials for corresponding external-service credentials.
For example, Taskcluster credentials can be used to control access to specific S3 buckets or even paths within those buckets.

The base credentials for these services are specified in the deployment configuration.
This ensures that they are closely guarded, but it also means that they are difficult to change dynamically.
As a best pratice, we recommend limiting use of these API methods to credentials that are widely useful in the deployment
For example, the Firefox-CI deployment provides credentials for AWS S3 buckets containing cached compiler outputs, that are used by most Firefox build tasks.

With the exception of Azure credentials (which are used by other Taskcluster services), configuration of all of these external services is optional.
