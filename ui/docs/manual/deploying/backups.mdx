# Backups and Restores

## Data Covered

The backup and restore utilities address the backend data for the Taskcluster services.
That includes:

 * all runtime configuration such as clients, roles, hooks, worker pools
 * stored status such as worker status and errors
 * task metadata including task definitions and status

Notably, backups do *not* include Task artifacts.
These are generally too large to practically back up.

This data is all contained in an Azure storage account, in tables and containers.
The backup command automatically backs up all tables and containers used by its version of the Taskcluster services.
The backup operation copies that data into an S3 bucket.

All backup operations are "full".
The storage backend does not support any kind of incremental approach.

## Running Backups

Like smoketests, backups can be run either from the root of the Taskcluster repository, or from the taskcluster/taskcluster-dev Docker image.
In either case, the following environment variables are required:

* `AZURE_ACCOUNT` / `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` -- the storage account and a key with access to that account
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` -- credentials with access to write to S3 (in fact, any credentials the AWS tools accept will work)
* `BACKUP_BUCKET` -- the bucket to which to write the data

With that information in place, run

```
$ yarn backup:run
yarn run v1.19.1
$ node infrastructure/tooling/src/main.js backup:run
⣟ Back up Table Clients
```

or

```
$ docker run -ti --rm \
  -e AZURE_ACCOUNT -e AZURE_ACCOUNT_ID -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e BACKUP_BUCKET \
  taskcluster/taskcluster-devel:v1.2.3 script/backup:run
yarn run v1.19.1
$ node infrastructure/tooling/src/main.js backup:run
⣟ Back up Table Clients
```

**NOTE** it's important that the version of the docker image correspond to the version of the deployed services.
Older versions may not be aware of all important tables and containers.

**NOTE** Taskcluster services encrypt data at rest where necessary.
It is not necessary to further encrypt backups.
Of course, backups should nonetheless be kept in a secure, non-public bucket.

### Excluding and Including

The `backup:run` command takes `--include` and `--exclude` arguments to include or exclude Azure resources from the run.
This is typically used to back up the large resources -- `table/QueueTasks` and `table/QueueArtifacts`, in particular -- less frequently.

```
# daily
docker run ... script/backup:run --exclude table/QueueTasks --exclude table/QueueArtifacts
# weekly
docker run ... script/backup:run --include table/QueueTasks --include table/QueueArtifacts
```

As long as every `--exclude` is matched by an `--include`, all resources should be adequately covered.

### Backup Lifecycle

We recommend using the tools provided by AWS S3 to manage the lifecycle of your backups.
Use versioning to keep multiple versions of each table, and use a lifecycle rule to delete older versions.

## Runing Restores

Restores are done one resource at a time.
All restore operations refuse to overwrite existing data, and must be performed to a fresh new table or container.
The `backup:restore` command takes the same environment variables as `backup:run`, and can be invoked via `yarn` or `docker`.

For example, to restore the latest backup of table Hooks to HooksRestore:

```
$ yarn backup:restore table/Hooks table/HooksRestore
```

To restore an earlier version, look up that version's VersionId in the S3 interface, and pass it to `backup:restore` with `--version-id`.

### Comparing Resources

When testing a restore, a successful `backup:restore` operation is a good first step, but it's also useful to determine that the restored data is correct.
To do so, compare the destination of the restore to the real resource, using `backup:compare`:

```
$ yarn backup:compare table/Hooks table/HooksRestore
✔ Fetch Table Hooks
✔ Fetch Table HooksRestore
✔ Compare
100% finished
Number of entities in table/Hooks: 164
Number of entities in table/Hooks not in table/HooksRestore: 0
Number of entities in table/HooksRestore: 165
Number of entities in table/HooksRestore not in table/Hooks: 1
Number of entities with matching keys that are different between the two: 0
```

Naturally, the real resource may have changed since the backup was taken.
The provided summary can help you spot the differences and similarities.
In this case, it appears that one hook has been added since the backup was taken.
