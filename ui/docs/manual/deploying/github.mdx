# GitHub Integration

The GitHub service requires a GitHub App in order to interact with GitHub.

## App Setup

To create such an app, use the docs at https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/.

* Ownership: if possible, create the application under a relevant GitHub organization.  Apps can be transferred after creation, though, so this is not critical.
* Name: not critical, but we recommend "&lt;deployment-name>-taskcluster".
* Homepage URL should link to your deployment's root URL
* Setup URL should link to your taskcluster instance's quickstart guide, `/quickstart` on your deployment's root URL
* Webhook URL should link to `/api/github/v1/github` on your deployment's root URL
* Set the secret to an arbitrary value that you also configure in your Taskcluster instance's settings.
* Set permissions as follows:
  * repo administration: read-only
  * checks: read & write
  * repo contents: read-only
  * content references, deployments: No access
  * issues: read & write
  * repo metadata: read-only
  * pages: no access
  * pull requests: read & write
  * repo webhooks, projects, security alerts, & single file: no access
  * commit statuses: read & write
  * organization members: read only
  * blocking org users, org projects, team discussions, org administration, org hooks, org plan: No access
  * user permissions: No access for any
  * subscribe to events: Pull request, Push, Release

## Taskcluster Configuration

In the Helm templates, you'll need to set

* `github.bot_username` -- this should match the name in the integration's URL.  For example, if the URL is https://github.com/apps/acme-taskcluster then the `bot_name` should be `acme-taskcluster`.
* `github.github_app_id` -- numeric app_id, visible in the app settings
* `github.github_private_pem` -- see below

On the app's settings page, generate a private key, and add its PEM to your Taskcluster instance's configs.
This is a multiline string.
If your deployment mechanics does not handle multiline values correctly, the newlines can be replaced by a literal `\``n` escape sequence, thus fitting on a single (long) line.
Note that the entire PEM key, including the "BEGIN" and "END" lines, must be included, with no additional whitespace or other formatting added or moved.
